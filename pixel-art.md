The other day I tried my hand at pixel art. I actually liked it a lot. You start with a canvas of lets say 64 x 64 pixels and upscale it later to a proper image size, otherwise it would be so tiny. From there it was a bit like painting by numbers. The first image is the knight from [Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com/). For the second image i took [Simon St√•lenhags](https://simonstalenhag.se/) work as reference. Later i added some details. For this I used the app [Pixaki](https://pixaki.com/) on the iPad, it is very easy to learn. I didnt like the animation implementation, i heard [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) is better for that. Or maybe i suck at it.
