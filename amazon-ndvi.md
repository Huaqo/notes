Amazon vegetation index (NDVI) over a year from 2021 - 2022. Google Earth Engine and MODIS satellite data were used to create this image. Dark green has a high index, indicating that there is a lot of vegetation going on. Light green shows weak vegetation activity. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to analyze remote sensing measurements, often from a space platform, assessing whether or not the target being observed contains live green vegetation.
